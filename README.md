# IDIS
Scripts completed during an internship at IDIS (Instituto de Investigaci√≥n Sanitaria de Santiago de Compostela), where I collaborated on two independent research projects: a cardiology study aimed at enhancing arrhythmia prevention techniques post-operation, and an educational strategy study at the Nursing Faculty focused on responding to potential heart attacks.
